### Goals 

##### Phase1 

* Use pre-trained model to identify the stripe with the white pixel. 
* See [this](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/vision/tensorflow_cs_2023/tensorflow-cs-2023.html#:~:text=A%20trained%20TensorFlow%20model%20was,CENTERSTAGE%20presented%20by%20RTX%20challenge.&text=TensorFlow%20Object%20Detection%20(TFOD)%20has,white%20Pixel%20during%20a%20match) for introduction to pre-trained model.
* See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FTC/comments/nycssw/how_to_get_the_coordinate_of_detected_object_in_a/?rdt=53346) for detecing distance
* We have to identify the stripe with the white pixel based on distance provided by the FTC SDK

##### Phase2

* Use ftc-ml tool to train a model to identify the team-prop
* Training the model is detailed [here](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/ftc_ml/managing_tool/create_videos/create-videos.html)
* Rest of the steps will be similar to phase 1
